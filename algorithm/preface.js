/**
 * recursion : when function refers to itself
 * commonly used in searcing and sorting
 * cons :
 * - stack overflowing
 * 
 * recursion should have a condition for stopping that function, if not it will occur infinite loops
 * 
 * three rules of recursion :
 * 1. identify the base case (when to stop)
 * 2. identify the recursive case
 * 3. get closer and closer, and return when needed.
 * Usually you have 2 returns (base case and recursive case)
