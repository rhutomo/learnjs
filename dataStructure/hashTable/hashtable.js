/**
 * Map() allows us to set any types of keys and values in object
 * Set() is a collection of items which are unique (no element can be repeated).
 *      Elements of the sets can be iterated in insertion order.
 *      allows us to set any types of values whether primitive or objects.
 * with using hash table, we optimize nested loops in arrays O(n^2) to O(n)
 * advantages :
 * - fast lookup
 * - fast insert
 * - flexible keys with Map() in javascript
 * disadvantages :
 * - unordered list
 * - slow key iteration
 * 
 * tradeoffs time with space memory
